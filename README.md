ofxNoisepp
==========

Openframeworks addon that implement the  Noisepp library, for making noise textures and other...

This addon is still under development. **ofxNoisepp** was tested under linux and Windows. The Noisepp lib is hosted here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/noisepp/ You can find inside the addon a linux lib for 64bit system, but i think you can easily build a different sytsem lib as you need by yourself. There is no  news updated versions of the lib but i think it is interesting for different features: threading, seamless creation, a quite choice of kernels and utilities, creations of 2d and 3d textures, and an Editor in which you can construct your texture and export a binary file with extension .pipeline the modules that you build. To do this you need to download the .zip file and build by yourself the editor. I would improve this editor is on my to do list with a better and friendly interface. Also in the near future i will add other examples, functions and utilities to the code.

## Featured to add
- more metthods and utilities
